# alexng353

ðŸ‘‹ hi, Iâ€™m Alex, I'm a 16 year old developer based in Vancouver, Canada. 
* I write a lot of react/ts, node/ts and python
* Learning rust to write high performance programs
* Can write GoLang but prefer not to
* Most of what I do is full stack web development for [@EduBeyond](https://github.com/EduBeyond)

See my work at [my website](https://ayo.icu) or at [EduBeyond's website](https://edubeyond.ca)
